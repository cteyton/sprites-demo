# Playwright MCP — UI demo recording tool reference

Quick lookup for the tools used by this skill, with the gotchas that bit us in the past.

## Tool prefixes

The Playwright MCP often shows up twice in `ToolSearch` — once with the stock prefix and once with a `_plugin_` prefix. They are different MCP servers with **different browser contexts**. The video tools belong to the stock prefix. Mixing prefixes in one recording causes `Browser is already in use` errors.

| Family used here | Family to avoid mixing in |
| --- | --- |
| `mcp__playwright__browser_*` | `mcp__plugin_playwright_playwright__browser_*` |

Pick one and stay with it for the whole recording.

## Video tools (require `--caps=devtools`)

| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `browser_start_video` | Begin recording | Accepts `filename` and `size: {width, height}`. Errors with `Screencast is already started` if a previous session left one open — call `stop_video` then retry. Errors with `Browser is already in use` if a non-recording session has the profile locked — `browser_close` first. |
| `browser_stop_video` | End recording | Returns one or more `[Video](./<name>.webm)` paths. The actual file lands at the **project root**, not `--output-dir`. Move it afterwards. |
| `browser_video_chapter` | Render a full-screen chapter card with blurred backdrop | `title` (required), optional `description` and `duration` in ms. Use 1500–3000ms. |
| `browser_highlight` | Persistent overlay around an element | `target` (snapshot ref), optional `style` for inline CSS. Pairs with `browser_hide_highlight`. |
| `browser_hide_highlight` | Remove a highlight | `target` and `element` must match what was passed to `browser_highlight`. |
| `browser_annotate` | Open Playwright Dashboard in annotation mode | Interactive — waits for human input. Not useful for automated recordings. |

## Driver tools used during a recording

| Tool | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `browser_navigate` | After this, reinject the cursor overlay. |
| `browser_snapshot` | Always take a fresh snapshot right before a click — refs change after re-renders. |
| `browser_click` | `target` is the ref from the latest snapshot. |
| `browser_type` | Pass `slowly: true` for text the viewer should read. |
| `browser_wait_for` | Prefer `text` / `textGone` over `time` — recordings made of `wait_for` text look like a real user; recordings made of fixed sleeps look robotic. |
| `browser_evaluate` | The only way to inject the cursor overlay. Also a fallback for state changes that don't propagate through MCP-synthesized events (drag-drop is the common case). |
| `browser_resize` | Use only when the size of the actual viewport matters; `start_video`'s `size` already sets the recording dimensions. |
| `browser_close` | Closes the tab. Useful between sessions when `start_video` complains about a locked profile. |

## Drag-and-drop gotcha

`browser_drag` dispatches mouse events but does not reliably trigger libraries that rely on PointerEvents (`@dnd-kit`, some custom DnD setups). Symptoms:

- The drop "lands" on the source column.
- Accessibility live-region announces a drop, but no state changes.
- The visual reorder doesn't happen.

When this happens, switch to driving state via the app's API from inside `browser_evaluate`, then `location.reload()`. The video still shows the column visually reordering — viewers can't tell the difference. Remember to reinject the cursor overlay after the reload.

## What's missing

- No `mouse_move` for free-form cursor animation. Cursor only moves on actual click/type events. To animate the cursor between actions, fire dummy hovers (`browser_hover` on a neutral element).
- No `initScript` exposed via MCP — the cursor injection must be repeated after every navigate/reload.
- No native screen capture of the OS cursor. Hence the DOM overlay.
- `--output-dir` config arg is honored for snapshots and logs but **not** for the WebM file. The WebM is written to the process CWD.
